# StochasticMISI
A stochastic model of a marine-terminating glacier. Includes MATLAB scripts to reproduce all results from Robel et al. 2019 in PNAS.

To reproduce the scientific (non-schematic figures) from Robel, Seroussi & Roe, 2019 in PNAS:
Figure 2: Noisy_GrowthRate_manuscript_rv2.m
Figure 3: ISSM_MedPersist.m
Figure 4: ISSM_CompEnsembles_v2.m

Post-processed output from ISSM ensembles used to makes figures 3 and 4 is also included in .mat files in this repository.
